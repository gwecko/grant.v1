An excellent showcase for why I love software development! <br/>

Inspired by the popular NYT game, this is a 6-letter variation I built
using React. Initially I created an unnecessary backend to learn some SQLite,
and removed it at deployment becuase it made more sense to store the 
dictionary in a JS array.

Enjoyâ€”it's tougher than the original!
