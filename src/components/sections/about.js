                Communication Technology and a minor in Computer Science.<br/><br/>I've
                since taught myself the ins and outs of web development, mostly

                to C++ class, things fell apart. During my software 1 class, my 
                laptop had to be sent away for repairs and I didn't seek the help I
                 needed. One of the few times I went to seek help, I accidentally
                knocked over a shelf of my professor's office. And I finished that 
                course with an F.<br/><br/>But I loved to learn about how all the systems we
                use function, and I wanted to create my own pieces of software. So
                here I am.<br/><br/>And I haven't knocked over any shelves since.

                I liked the JS-React-Gatsby stack used to build this site so I'm
                going to continue with those for now.<br/><br/>However, if I see a website I really like, 
                I'll find out what makes it spin and learn that.

                At one of the coffee places I frequent, the barista is also learning web
                development. I can look forward to asking each other what we've been working on and
                finding solutions. Wherever I work, I would like to find more of that collaboration.
                <br/><br/>Eventually, I'd like to be able to do 5x what I can do now in a fraction of
                the time.

        The lesson I learned here is that the page is rendered
        once upon load, and only things which are 'stateful'â€”
        meaning they implement the 'useState' hook, are
        re-rendered. I had a "working" solution for a while
        because the console.log would show updated info, but
        the page wouldn't display it. It wasn't until I set
        the 'className' ternary operator to the 'stateful' 
        variable that I got a TRUE working solution.
        
        This function re-renders the whole array. I couldn't
        find a better solution and the most helpful posting
        suggested that this is the proper way to do it.
    
        What's going on:
        1. takes 'key' from corresponding button
        2. maps through whole array, if they key matches index,
           then that item is updated
        3. updates the state of the array, which is re-rendered
