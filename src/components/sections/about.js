                After my intro

                laptop had to be sent away for repairs and I didn't seek the help I 
                needed. One of the few times I went to seek help, I accidentally
                knocked over a shelf of my professor's office. And I finished that

        The lesson I learned here is that the page is rendered
        once upon load, and only things which are 'stateful'â€”
        meaning they implement the 'useState' hook, are
        re-rendered. I had a "working" solution for a while
        because the console.log would show updated info, but
        the page wouldn't display it. It wasn't until I set
        the 'className' ternary operator to the 'stateful' 
        variable that I got a TRUE working solution.
        
        This function re-renders the whole array. I couldn't
        find a better solution and the most helpful posting
        suggested that this is the proper way to do it.
    
        What's going on:
        1. takes 'key' from corresponding button
        2. maps through whole array, if they key matches index,
           then that item is updated
        3. updates the state of the array, which is re-rendered
